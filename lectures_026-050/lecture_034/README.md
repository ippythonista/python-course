# Exercise 7:

Write a program that asks the user for their first name.
If the name has 4 letters or fewer, it should display
`"Your name is short"`; if it has between 5 and 6 letters,
it should display `"Your name is normal"`; if it has more
than 6 letters, it should display `"Your name is very long"`.
