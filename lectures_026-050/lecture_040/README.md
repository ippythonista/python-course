# Exercise 9:

Create a calculator, following the given instructions:

- Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in a variable.
- Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in another variable.
- Prompt the user to select the arithmetic operation they want to perform (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication,
  division).
- Based on the user's input, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation on the two numbers.
- If the operation is division and the second number is zero, display an error message indicating that division by zero
  is not allowed.
- If the operation is valid and both numbers are numeric, display the result to the user.
  Provide an option to the user to perform more calculations or exit the program.
