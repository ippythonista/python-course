# Exercise 3:

Given the following variables:

```python
first = input("First: ")
last = input("Last: ")
```

Use the `if/elif/else` statements to determine the appropriate outcome:
> first='10' is greater than last='9'<br />
> last='10' is greater than first='9'<br />
> first='10' is equal to last='10'
